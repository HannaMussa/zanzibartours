### Color Scheme

### Typography

- Lato was selected as the primary font for the body text, with sans-serif as a fallback in case Lato fails to load.

- For headings and subheadings, Playfair Display was used, with Georgia as the backup font.

Lato was chosen for its readability and clarity, while Playfair Display, commonly used on luxury websites, provides a blend of traditional and modern aesthetics. The contrast between Lato and Playfair Display creates a visually appealing and well-balanced typographic combination.

FontAwesome icons were used across the site, primarily in the footer.

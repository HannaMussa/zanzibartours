### Color Scheme

what was color theme, and why?

### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was selected as the primary font for the body text. 

- [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) was used for headings and subheadings.

 - [Sans-serif](https://fonts.google.com/?query=sans-serif) was used as a fallback font in case the other fonts fails to load. 

Lato was chosen for its readability and clarity, while Playfair Display, commonly used on luxury websites, provides a blend of traditional and modern aesthetics. The contrast between Lato and Playfair Display creates a visually appealing and well-balanced typographic combination.

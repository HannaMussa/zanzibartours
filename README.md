## UX

From the first click, users should immediately recognize that the website focuses on Zanzibar tours. This is accomplished with a full-width, autoplaying carousel designed to capture attention. High-resolution images are used to enhance visual appeal and create an engaging experience.

### Color Scheme

[Image picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) was used to generate a color palette. The color scheme follows a clean and modern style that complements the websites color palette. The key colors include:

- Headings were styled in `tertiary-color: #0c5c59`, providing a strong yet elegant contrast.
- Navigation links & footer icons used `primary-color: #2f2a30` for a refined, cohesive look.
- Button hover effects adopted `secondary-color: #f2e9d5`, enhancing interactivity.
- Hovered buttons and social links featured the `highlight-color: #30bbb4` for emphasis.

### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was selected as the primary font for the body text.

- [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) was used for headings and subheadings.

- [Sans-serif](https://fonts.google.com/?query=sans-serif) was used as a fallback font in case the other fonts fails to load.

Lato was chosen for its readability and clarity, while Playfair Display, commonly used on luxury websites, provides a blend of traditional and modern aesthetics. The contrast between Lato and Playfair Display creates a visually appealing and well-balanced typographic combination.

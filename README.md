## UX
On the first click, I wanted users to immediately recognize that the website focuses on Zanzibar tours. This is achieved through a full-width autoplaying carousel, designed to capture attention. High-resolution images are used to enhance visual appeal and further engage users.

### Color Scheme

### Typography

Lato was used as the primary font for the body text, with sans-serif serving as a backup in the event that lato failed to load. 
 Playfair Display was used for headings and subheadings, while Georgia served as a backup font.  Lato was chosen because it is a readable and clear font.  Playfair Display was often used for luxury websites, and it offers a traditional yet modern look.  Lato and Playfair Display have a good contrast deal, making them a good match.


 FontAwesome icons were used across the site, primarily in the footer.
